Running AI models on embedded devices opens up possibilities that cloud-based solutions can't match. Here's what I've learned.

## Why edge AI?

- **Latency** - No network round-trip means real-time responses
- **Privacy** - Data never leaves the device
- **Reliability** - Works offline, no dependency on cloud services
- **Cost** - No per-inference cloud costs

## The hardware landscape

Modern edge AI runs on a variety of hardware:

| Platform | Pros | Cons |
|----------|------|------|
| NVIDIA Jetson | Powerful GPU | Power hungry |
| Raspberry Pi 5 | Accessible | Limited ML acceleration |
| ESP32-S3 | Low power, cheap | Very limited models |
| Google Coral | Fast inference | Model conversion required |

## Model optimization

Edge devices have limited resources. You need to optimize:

```python
# Quantize model to int8
converter = tf.lite.TFLiteConverter.from_saved_model(model_path)
converter.optimizations = [tf.lite.Optimize.DEFAULT]
converter.target_spec.supported_types = [tf.int8]
tflite_model = converter.convert()
```

Quantization can reduce model size by 4x with minimal accuracy loss.

## Real-world applications

I've been working on:

- **Computer vision** for robotics navigation
- **Anomaly detection** in industrial equipment
- **Voice recognition** for offline assistants

The key is choosing the right model architecture for your constraints.

## The future

As hardware gets more capable and models get more efficient, we'll see AI everywhere - in your car, your appliances, your tools. The devices around us are about to get a lot smarter.
