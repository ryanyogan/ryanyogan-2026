Over my career, I've had the opportunity to build engineering teams from the ground up multiple times. Here's what I've learned.

## Start with culture, not processes

The first few hires set the tone for everything that follows. I prioritize:

- **Ownership mentality** - People who take responsibility for outcomes, not just tasks
- **Bias for action** - Ship first, iterate later
- **Intellectual honesty** - Being able to say "I don't know" or "I was wrong"

## Hire for trajectory, not just experience

Early-stage teams need people who can grow with the company. Look for:

```typescript
// The kind of engineer you want
const idealCandidate = {
  curiosity: "insatiable",
  learningRate: "exponential",
  ego: "checked at the door",
};
```

## Process should follow problems

Don't implement Scrum because everyone does it. Add process only when you feel the pain of not having it.

When we hit 15 engineers, we needed better coordination. When we hit 30, we needed clearer ownership boundaries. Let the org's needs drive the structure.

## The hardest part

The hardest part isn't the technical challenges - it's the people challenges. Managing expectations, having difficult conversations, and making decisions with incomplete information.

But that's also what makes it rewarding.
