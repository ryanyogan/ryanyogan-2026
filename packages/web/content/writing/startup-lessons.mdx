# Lessons from startup life

After spending years at startups of various stages, here are the lessons that stuck with me.

## Ship fast, learn faster

The biggest mistake I see is over-engineering early. Your first version should be embarrassingly simple:

```typescript
// Bad: Over-engineering from day one
class UserServiceFactoryProviderImpl implements IUserServiceFactory {
  // 500 lines of abstraction
}

// Good: Just ship it
async function createUser(email: string) {
  return db.users.create({ email });
}
```

You can always add complexity later. You can't get back the time spent building the wrong thing.

## Talk to users constantly

I used to think my job was to write code. Now I know it's to solve problems. The best way to understand problems is to talk to the people who have them.

Schedule weekly calls with users. Watch them use your product. Feel their frustration.

## Technical debt is a tool

Used wisely, technical debt lets you move fast when speed matters. The key is knowing when to pay it back:

- **Take on debt** to validate ideas quickly
- **Pay it back** before scaling
- **Never ignore** security or data integrity debt

## The team is everything

I've seen great ideas fail with bad teams and mediocre ideas succeed with great teams. Hire people you'd want to work with for years.

## Know when to leave

Sometimes the right move is to walk away - from a project, a company, or an approach. It's not giving up; it's making room for something better.
